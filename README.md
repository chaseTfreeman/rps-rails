# RPS-Rails

## Getting Started

To get started, clone  the repo and run `cd rps-rails` to change to the root directory.

For the un-styled version of RPS, use the master branch and enter the following:

```bash
bundle install
rails s
```

To play the styled version, swtich to the "styles" branch (`git checkout styles`) before running `rails s`
